# What's this

My Cydia repository, add `repo.tsunderedev.moe` in Cydia to get it.

It's basically got whatever random themes I decide I want to make and use for myself. I'm told sharing is caring so why not let everyone use them?

No tweaks since I don't know how to write them. (Maybe someday in the future?)

# Themes

* **Saber & Lancer** - Line Messages theme
* **Cataracs Custom Cover** - Custom Cover theme inspired by my friend [Jesse Bryan](https://github.com/Winneon)'s lockscreen theme Cataracs
* Various Lock Glyph themes - a **Kingdom Hearts** crown, Simon's drill from **Gurren Lagann**, **Of Monsters and Men**'s album covers for the singles they've been releasing
* **Binary Keypad Theme**
