		<h2>Description</h2>

			<li>
				<p>
					Nagato is a flat widget that will compliment many currently popular icon themes on iOS 7 and 8. It includes time, weather forecast, a calendar for the week, battery percent indicator, and a charging indicator.
				</p>
				<p>
					The battery percent indicator is made using CSS, and thus should (I haven't actually verified this, but I'm fairly certain it's true) put less strain on your device when compared to similar widgets which use images to indicate battery percent. (It also makes the file size of the theme much smaller!) Since it is made using CSS, that also means you can easily customize the colors that it shows to match your theme or wallpaper. :D <i>For details on how to customize, please take a look at the Reddit post linked below.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					Nagato requires <strong>GroovyLock</strong> or <strong>LockHTML 3/4</strong> for the lockscreen and <strong>SBHTML</strong> for the springboard. <strong>InfoStats</strong> will be installed alongside Nagato. (this is for the battery indicator)
