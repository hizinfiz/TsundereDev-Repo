		<h2>Description</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					I swore off making icon themes, but I couldn't stay away for long. This is Mugi, a vibrant theme based on gradients and Adobe's iOS app icons.
				</p>
				<p>
					This theme is currently in beta and still very much a work in progress. I'll be posting regular updates and constantly changing things, so I appreciate your patience and welcome you aboard for the ride. Once I'm happy with the quality and number of icons, I'll probably put this on a default repo for free.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not drinking tea and eating cake, I'll push updates once every one or two weeks. Come fall when classes start again, it'll be reduced to approximately once a month. You can expect updates at the end of the week, usually on Fridays or Saturdays.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your feedback is greatly appreciated, so if you feel like a certain icon needs changing, please let me know, and I'll take it into consideration! If you would like a certain icon with a different background color, I can make that for you as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>I am not taking icon requests at this time.</strong> Let me get a decent number of icons done first. When I'm ready to take icon requests, I'll open up a form and make it available.
				</p>

					I took a lot of inspiration from <a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.macciti.axla2/">Axla</a> and this <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1778760-Colourful-Icons">unfinished concept</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/meteochu">Meteochu</a> and <a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.macciti.muze/">Muze</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Purdixx">Purdix</a>. Thank you as well to <a href="https://twitter.com/djaovx">Djaovx</a> (<a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.modmyi.enkel/">Enkel</a>) for the feedback during the design process. Go buy their themes and follow them on Twitter, they're super awesome people!
